Ansible Role: SSL
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bjoernalbers/ansible-role-ssl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bjoernalbers/ansible-role-ssl)

This role generates a self-signed Certificate Authority (CA) which then
signs each of you certificates.
Just deploy the CA certificate on your clients in order to trust your
certificates.
All stuff is by default located under `~/ssl`.

Command Line Tools.

- `ssl_state`: State or Province Name
